                <p>Monopoly, a popular board game sold in over 103 countries, originated in the United States in 1903. Initially known as "The Landlord's Game," it was created by Elizabeth Magie to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. The game was modified over time and was eventually rebranded as Monopoly by Charles Darrow in the 1930s, who sold it to Parker Brothers. Despite the controversy over its origin, Monopoly went on to become a phenomenal success, with numerous variations created over the years, including city-themed, sports-themed, movie-themed editions, and even video game versions. It continues to be a global favorite in board games.
